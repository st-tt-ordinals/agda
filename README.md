### Agda development of the paper "Set-Theoretic and Type-Theoretic Ordinals Coincide"

All the Agda files are tested Agda version 2.6.2.2 and
- Section II is building on Escard√≥'s [TypeTopology](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology) library (commit: [318d913c878c1f3cbcfd03c911ed6c1461bf1d9f](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology/tree/318d913c878c1f3cbcfd03c911ed6c1461bf1d9f)), and
- Section III is building on the [Cubical Agda library](https://github.com/agda/cubical) ([version 0.4](https://github.com/agda/cubical/releases/tag/v0.4)).

An html rendering of the Agda code is available [here](https://st-tt-ordinals.github.io/index.html).
